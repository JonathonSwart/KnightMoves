The KnightMove project will take a text file (knight.txt or knight2.txt) and will calculate the shortest
amount of moves the knight can make in order to reach a specified location on the chess board. The knight
has an unordinary pattern than other pieces on the chess board which makes it tougher to find the
shortest path

By running the code it will output the correct moves to make to get to a specified spot on the chess
board. To change which text file is the code reads, go to line 96 and change 'filename' to either
"knight.txt" or "knight2.txt".
